# Python-Arcade-Demo

Learning python arcade. This will be a demo of basic functionality.

# Overview

I am currently (as I write this) on a team developing a game in python with the arcade library. This program was a quick crash course in the arcade library. I wanted to test the basic functionalities so that I
would be a more effective member of the team.

This game is a simple endless game where the player must dodge falling rocks.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

It makes extensive use of the python Arcade library

# Future Work

While I have no plans to develope this further, if I were to do it again I would:

- Create custom graphics
- Add a score system
- Add a game over screen/start menu
